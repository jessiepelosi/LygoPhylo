# Lygodium Phylogenomics 

This repository is for code and data related to the target-capture analysis of the genus <i>Lygodium</i> as presented in the paper: 

>All tangled up: Unraveling phylogenetics and reticulate evolution in the vining ferns, <i>Lygodium</i> (Lygodiaceae, Schizaeales)

Raw sequencing data can be found under BioProject PRJNA1040242 in the NCBI SRA. 

Code and information on the analyses of the data presented are available in the [Phylogenomics directory](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Phylogenomics). 

Under the Data folder, you can access: 
1. [Multiple sequence alignments](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/MultipleSequenceAligns) for the target-only and target+flanking datasets generated using the GoFlag pipeline, HybPiper, PhyloHerb, PATÃ‰, and HybPhaser. 
2. [Gene trees](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/trees/gene_trees) corresponding to those alignments.
3. [Species trees](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/trees/species_trees) produced by concatenation and multiple-species coalescent models.
4. [Spore data](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/spores)

  
[Voucher information](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/blob/main/Voucher_Info.csv) for specimens sequenced in this study is available in the main directory.
