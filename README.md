# Lygodium Phylogenomics 

This repository is for code and data related to the target-capture analysis of the genus <i>Lygodium</i> as presented in the paper: 

>All tangled up: Unraveling phylogenetics and reticulate evolution in the vining ferns, <i>Lygodium</i> (Lygodiaceae, Schizaeales)
>
>Jessie A. Pelosi, Bethany A. Zumwalde, Weston L. Testo, Emily H. Kim, J. Gordon Burleigh, and Emily B. Sessa.

Raw sequencing data can be found under BioProject XXX in the NCBI SRA. 

Under the Data folder, you can access: 
1. [Multiple sequence alignments](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/MultipleSequenceAligns) for the target-only and target+flanking datasets generated using the GoFlag pipeline, HybPiper, PhyloHerb, PATÃ‰, and HybPhaser. 
2. [Gene trees](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/trees/gene_trees) corresponding to those alignments.
3. [Species trees](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/LygoPhylo/tree/main/Data/trees/species_trees) produced by concatenation and multiple-species coalescent models.
4. Spore data. 
5. Voucher information for specimens sequenced in this study.
